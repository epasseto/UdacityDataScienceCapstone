# Udacity Data Science Couse Capstpone

## Dog Breeding Identification Project

####Objective:

The main idea to this project is to have contact with **Perceptrons** technology.

The theoretical concepts involved in **Perceptrons** are not so new. I fact, **Frank Rosenblatt** was evolving that was known as the **first** Perceptron in the history, in 1958, for military applications (source, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)).

With the evolving of computers, specially **GPUs** (Graphic Processor Units), the search for machineas that could emulate the working of a **neuron** was intensified. The proposal is, with **minimal** human intervention, to train a machine that can make tasks involving **Classification** or **Fitting Curves** at least so well as humans can do. Perceptrons evolved in a way that they proved to be a great alternative for some kinds of problems, as **Image Classification**.

The task proposed by **Udacity** as Capstone for **Data Science Nanodegree** was to make some experimentation involving **Perceptrons**. Perceptrons are also known as a **Deep Learning Technique**, what means that it involve more than one layer of learning.

Udacity provided for this project, a **Jupyter Notebook** and **Extra Classes** as part of the learning process. The programming language involved is **Python**, and also some specific libraries, as **Pandas** (for dataframes opperations), **Keras** (for Deep Learning machines), and **Numpy** (for mathematica/geometrical operations), just to cite some of them.

## Metodology

Udacity metodology is strongly inspired by the formula **DCR** (**Drive, Correct, Repeat**). This small acronym refers for the learning process involved in training a new car driver:

> - first, the instructor gives you some **orientation** about safety rules and the tasks you will need to do, and then letting you to try by yourself (**Drive**);
> - second, you will be **corrected** from your mistakes and how to avoid them. If is necessary, new explanations will be given for a better drive experience (**Correct**);
> - third, you will be oriented to try again, and again, until you achieve the necessary **expertise** for driving a car by yourself (**Repeat**).

As an **analogy** to learning how to drive a car, some explanation is given in an **incomplete** Jupyter Notebook. Explanatory notes will be found in all your learning process. And if you stuck in some point, you can as for **Mentor** help. I made it a lot of times. And having a **Mentor** (not quite a **Mentat**, like you can see in this Sci-Fi movie **Dune** - 2021) is really a good thing, when you are lost in a forest of **Coding** trees!

## Parts of the project

#### Step 0: Import Datasets

Also I needed to import my libraries and was asked to create/evolve some predefine **functions** for making everything running well. It was not so hard!

#### Step 1: Detect Humans

The idea was to use as base a OpenCV (a public domain face detector) and a bunch of pre-loaded data. And then was invited to create my own **Human Face Dectector**, giving a picture do say if a human was there or not.

#### Step 2: Detect Dogs

As this is a project for **Dog Breeding Detection**, the next step was to make the same thing, involving now images and evolving a pre-trained **Dog Detector**. The involved technology for both detectors was **CNN** (**Convolutional Neural Networks**).

#### Step 3:
