### Involved files:

- `dogg_app.ipynb` →  the most important notebook file in this project, is where you can run the project and test it for results in new images classifications;

  - if you really want to run it, you will need a computer with `Jupyter Notebook` pre-installed and an active **GPU** to run it;

  - the data files that are not provided in this **GitHub**, you will need to donwload them from the propper sources, in a way to run this project;

- `dog_breed_analysis.ipynb` → the complete **data analysis** for our Human / Dog images;

- `Project_Main_Relatory` → all the documentation concerning this project (including proposition, steps to implement, metrics, etc..).
