    "\n",
    "*\"There are many cases in which classification accuracy is **not a good indicator** of your model performance. One of these scenarios is when your class distribution is **imbalanced** (one class is more frequent than others). In this case, even if you predict all samples as the most frequent class you would get a high accuracy rate, which does not make sense at all (because your model is not learning anything, and is just predicting everything as the top class)\"*\n",

    "\n",
    "- basically you are training a Perceptron to be so speciallized on **Alaska Malamute** doggos. And then, even the teeths, or the whiskers of this big dog breed will be well-understood by our Perceptron artificial neurons;\n",
    "\n",
    "- it is a kind of the problem to having a **dog kennel** in hour house. And then taking someone to take a look for your precious dogs. And of course, you don´t have all the **dog breeds** in the planet. And this guy will learn everything about some kinds of dogs. But when he moves into another kennel, in another house, he will turn really confused, about **new breeds**, and new ways to grow them, and everything;\n",
    "\n",
    "- what to do? We could just delete the extra files for taking a **more balanced** dataset. It have a cost, as we will have less pictures to show to our Perceptron. Or we could try other metrics. **Towards Data Science** article says, for in these cases, try **Precision** metrics. So we could start trying other metrics for this data.\n",

    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea to this project is to have contact with **Perceptrons** technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical concepts involved in **Perceptrons** are not so new. I fact, **Frank Rosenblatt** was evolving that was known as the **first** Perceptron in the history, in 1958, for military applications (source, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the evolving of computers, specially **GPUs** (Graphic Processor Units), the search for machineas that could emulate the working of a **neuron** was intensified. The proposal is, with **minimal** human intervention, to train a machine that can make tasks involving **Classification** or **Fitting Curves** at least so well as humans can do. Perceptrons evolved in a way that they proved to be a great alternative for some kinds of problems, as **Image Classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task proposed by **Udacity** as Capstone for **Data Science Nanodegree** was to make some experimentation involving **Perceptrons**. Perceptrons are also known as a **Deep Learning Technique**, what means that it involve more than one layer of learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Udacity provided for this project, a **Jupyter Notebook** and **Extra Classes** as part of the learning process. The programming language involved is **Python**, and also some specific libraries, as **Pandas** (for dataframes opperations), **Keras** (for Deep Learning machines), and **Numpy** (for mathematica/geometrical operations), just to cite some of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the project is to Train/Test Perceptrons for **Face Recognition** and test the possibility to transform them to **Dog Recognition**. Later, to train them for **Dog Breed Recognition**. And finally, creating a general Perceptron for, given an image, telling it there was a **human** there, or a **dog**, or neither a **human or dog**. And as an add, if a **human** face was found, to give a guess, if it was a **dog**, what dog breed is more similar to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "[a brief outline of the steps that you'll take to solve the problem. In other words, you should briefly mention the preprocessing, deep learning, and refinement approaches that you'll use to address the problem]\n",

    "## Parts of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 0: Import Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Also I needed to import my libraries and was asked to create/evolve some predefine **functions** for making everything running well. It was not so hard!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Detect Humans\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea was to use as base a OpenCV (a public domain face detector) and a bunch of pre-loaded data. And then was invited to create my own **Human Face Dectector**, giving a picture do say if a human was there or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Detect Dogs\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is a project for **Dog Breeding Detection**, the next step was to make the same thing, involving now images and evolving a pre-trained **Dog Detector**. The involved technology for both detectors was **CNN** (**Convolutional Neural Networks**). Pre-processing phases involved turning a Image into a Tensor, evolving functions to turn this step easier. Predictions were made using a pre-trained CNN named **ResNet-50**. Then I was invited to write my own **Dog Detector**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Create a CNN from Zero\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, I was asked to create my own **CNN** to classify **Dog Breeds**. In this time, from Scratch. That means that I will not be using third-part ready-made technology. I needed to crate my own **Architecture** and was asked for **at least 1%** of Accuracy on the **Test** dataframe. It sounds as a **easy** task, but it is not so! Some dog breads are some similar from one to another that it is really **hard**, even for me, to tell exactly what the breed is, giving a picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some adjustments were suggested (my first **Accuracy** was only 0,93%), like to add **Dropout** Layers, for preventing **Overfitting** during the Train phase. To determine the best number of **Epochs** (machine states, that creates a model to be evaluated), mas for me, a bit **challenging**. My best Accuracy was near to **12%**. Not so bad, for a written from zero model!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea in this step was to use pre-trained **Bottlenecks** and then just adding new layers form zero, to be trained. It sounds as a **strange** idea, as we were using first Perceptron Layers trained for other uses (as detecting **Human**) faces for a dog-detection task, but it makes some sense:\n",
    "\n",
    ">- general patterns are **universal**, so the first layers of a Perceptron could detect, by long training, to capture skin texture, background differentiation, horizontal and vertical lines, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    ">- pictures containing **faces**, being from a human, or a dog, have some similarities. As the general shape, the contrast between the face-area and the background, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    ">- a so-well trained **Bottleneck** was evolved so much, trained with hundreds of thousands of images, even **millions** of images, that the captured patterns are really reliable!\n",
    "\n",
    "I was asked to complete the Model Architecture, adding some Layers by myself. This demmanded a bit of **study** of what these Layers could do for me, the **dimmensions** involved, and a lot of **parameters** to set. The model was then compiled, trained and checked for Accuracy on the **Test** Dataframe. Some **Dog Breeds** were predicted with the new Model, now with a Test Accuracy near to **40%**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds\n",
    "\n",
    "This time the tactic evolved to using **Transfer Learning**. The expected Accuracy was at least **60%** at the Test Dataframe. We were invited to experiment with some Bottlenecks available in Keras (some of them earned very **notable** prizes!). Whe could use things like VGG-19, ResNet-50, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "I obtained some of these Bottlenecks (not all of them, as we had limited **GPU Time** and Storage Capacity on Udacity servers). Then, I created a Function for making adjustments and iterating with my chosen Bottlenecks (**ResNet-50** and **InceptionV3**). After a quite hard job, I could at the same time, evolve a better **Tester/Feeder** Function, that I named **The Charger**, and obtain the best parameters that I could find for attaining near to **75%** of Accuracy on Test Dataframe. Not bad at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "For **fun** I took one picture of myself and tested on my already trained Classifier. And if I was a dog, my breed should be **Silky Terrier**! Oh, it was a really **good momen** for a joke!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Write your Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea now is to create a Application by myself. So, taken a pre-trained Classifier and some pictures in **public domain** and the ones already preexistent in a Udacity folder to say:\n",
    "\n",
    ">- if there is a **dog** in the picture;\n",
    ">- if there is a **human** in the picture;\n",
    ">- if a **human** was found, what it will be his most likely **dog breed** it it was a **dog**;\n",
    ">- give error warnings, if something went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7: Test your Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. every **dog** I tested, from Udacity folder, was recognized as a dog and **only** as a dog (not a human). Nice;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. some of the \"humans\" that I tested form free domain images, were tested as **humans** (Einstein picture, Mr Spock from Star Treck, Roland Macdonalds and even Fofão - a man dressed as a dog, very famous in Brazillian culture). They also passed in the test to **not** being a dog, and received some (only for **humor**!) dog breeds tags if they were dogs, what breed they could be;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. two of the \"humans\" didn´t pass in the **human** test. One was a picture from **Werewolf**, a 1995 movie and for (**obvious**!) reasons, the monster was **not** interpreted as a human! The other one was my own picture and the most likely reason is that it is a so **distorted** pic, taken with my old webcam, and so **badly** reshaped for 224x224 image that the Perceptron could not recognize it as a human. OK, I can pass with this idea!  "
