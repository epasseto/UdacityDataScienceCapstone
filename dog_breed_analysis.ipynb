    "#### 1. Description of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data is based on pictures, and the input format for our Perceptron is **(224x224)** Pixels. Almost our data comes in RGB format, that means **3 layers** of (224x224). When reading the pictures is possible to force the resize for this format, so even if there are some pics in a bad format, they will be reshaped to this format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Por processing, is made a reduction to **grayscale**, so the color information is lost. That is a not so hard problem, as a lot of pictures came in **distorted colors**. Our modern digital cameras opperates in a way that an algorithm tries to correct the **color temperature** of images. And there are no indication, following the image, for what color temperature the sensor was adjusted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perceptrons are trained to deal with **pattern identification**, so the process of image transformation to 1 layer, grayscale, turns our focus more in trying to learn patterns, as vertical lines, or kind of whiskers, or skin/hair texture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also we have a **label** column for each picture. So, basically what we are dealing with is **Supervised Learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Dealing Dogs and  humans\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, we have as input two different datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the **first** one, for **dogs** - the data is already divided in 3 parts;\n",
    "\n",
    "  - one for **Training**, where 80% of our data is there;\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - one for **Testing**, containing 10% of our data and;\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - one for **Validation**, containing 10% of our original data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- the **second** one, for humans - all the data is there, and a method will be later applied for data sepparation.\n",

    "*\"There are many cases in which classification accuracy is **not a good indicator** of your model performance. One of these scenarios is when your class distribution is **imbalanced** (one class is more frequent than others). In this case, even if you predict all samples as the most frequent class you would get a high accuracy rate, which does not make sense at all (because your model is not learning anything, and is just predicting everything as the top class)\"*\n",

And of course, you don´t have all the **dog breeds** in the planet. And this guy will learn everything about some kinds of dogs. But when he moves into another kennel, in another house, he will turn really confused, about **new breeds**, and new ways to grow them, and everything;\n",
    "\n",
    "- what to do? We could just delete the extra files for taking a **more balanced** dataset. It have a cost, as we will have less pictures to show to our Perceptron.

    "- because our Perceptron, when a **new** image is shown, learns in the first layers, about **basic patterns**, evolving more and more accurate **filters**;\n",
    "\n",
    "- so these filters can interpret for example **skin crackes**, our **hair/beard texture**, and passing more and more pics, they tend to be more and more Accurate!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing for us to concern abbout is how professional photographers take pictures from **notorious persons** and form **general people**. The ways that these pictures were taken can **affect** how our Perceptron will learn. So, it tends to, if I show a lot of pictures form notorious persons, not interpret so well normal people. In a extreme situation, common people tends to **not** be recognized as humans by a Perceptron trained too much on pictures from politicians, or famous actors, for example. We don´t dress in the same way, we don´t use so much some accessories, like dark sunglasses, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "So the **impact** of unbalanced **dog* and **human** datasets is that this affects negatively our Accuracy for Testing dataset, as it turns our Pereceptron more **biased**."
